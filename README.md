A cheminformatics tool that extracts and summarizes knowledge about compounds from 20+ sources.
It then outputs that knowledge in a consistent, human-readable and machine-readable format.

*Status: alpha. The 0.1 release is functional but only used ChEMBL.*

Running it on alprazolam:

```bash
echo "VREFGVBLTWBCJP-UHFFFAOYSA-N" > compounds.txt
mandos search all compounds.txt
```

It will output a CSV file containing extended data, and a simple text file of compound–predicate–object triples.  
Here is a sample of lines in the resulting text file:

```
