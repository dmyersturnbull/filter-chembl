The ‚Äúkitchen sink‚Äù preprocessing tool for chemical screens:  
**Fetch knowledge on compounds from public databases, squeezing it all into a consistent form.**

**Note:** This repo is a testbed and will eventually be dramatically simplified.

Mandos extracts ~30 annotation types, including:

- mechanisms of action (MOAs), binding activity, classifications, pathways involved, gene expression effects,
- disease indications, clinical trials, drug‚Äìdrug interactions, co-occurring literature terms,
- legal statuses, LD50, health hazards, acute exposure effects, physical properties, ...

Output in CSV files is summarized as _semantic triples_,
such as `alprazolam inactive at BK receptor`, with additional data (e.g. EC50 or clinical phase).
It can also fetch annotations for structurally similar compounds.

### üí° Common uses

It‚Äôs a preprocessing tool for algorithms and data analysis on chemical screens.
_Example uses:_

- What distinguishes your screening hits pharmacologically?
- What distinguishes groups from a multidimensional screen?
- Build a training set for machine learning.
- Make sure your results aren‚Äôt explained by something like solubility.

These tasks are often performed with just [ATC codes](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/glossary/atc-code)
or binding to [ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) targets.
But if your compounds lack ATC codes, or binding annotations ‚Äì or don‚Äôt correlate with binding ‚Äì
you can compare against far more pharmacological variables, such as GO terms and literature co-occurrences.
You can also get targets like `GABA-A receptor; anion channel` rather than specific GABA-A subunits and complexes.

### üé® Example

Use Mandos as a Python API or command-line tool.
To search just the mechanism of action for alprazolam:

```bash
echo "VREFGVBLTWBCJP-UHFFFAOYSA-N" > compounds.txt
mandos chembl:mechanism compounds.txt
```

The following info is perhaps enough to get started, but a lot is done behind-the-scenes.
**[See the docs üìö](https://mandos-chem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** for more.

**Input:** compounds.txt is a line-by-line list of
[InChI Keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemical_Identifier#InChIKey)
Pass type-specific command-line options like `--taxa vertebrata`,
or run multiple searches with `mandos :search compounds.txt searches.toml`.
(See: [example config file](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/mandos/blob/main/mandos/resources/ags_example.toml))
`mandos <type> --help` will show and briefly explain the options.

**Output:** 10 columns shared between all files, plus type-specific columns.
The consistent columns are: _record_id_, _inchikey_, _compound_id_, _compound_name_,
_predicate_, _object_id_, _object_name_, _weight_, _search_key_, _data_source_, and _universal_id_.
Additional columns include EC50, original name, species, clinical phase, etc.
