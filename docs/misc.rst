Miscellaneous annotations
=========================

Indications / trials
****************************

ChEMBL indication annotations are just the trials conducted, regardless of their result.
This results in some phase 3 annotations that are inconsistent with the actual approvals.
The DrugBank search is better and should include almost everything that the ChEMBL search does.
Thereâ€™s also a DrugBank clinical trial search (``db_trial``) that should be more equivalent
to the ChEMBL one.
